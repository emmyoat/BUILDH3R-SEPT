 Use Case: Cross-Chain NFT Marketplace with ZKM
A decentralized NFT marketplace that allows users to buy, sell, and trade digital assets across multiple blockchain in a very convenient and efficient way.Using ZKM's Entangled Rollup and Hybrid Rollup concepts, this marketplace could bridge incompatible blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, ensuring trustless communication and transactions between them.
In this proposed use case, when a user starts the NFT selling process on Ethereum, the transaction could be cryptographically validated and processed on a Layer 2 (L2) Rollup, with the transaction proof being sent to Solana's blockchain. Through the Entangled Rollup approach, the ZKM permits the transaction to be carried out safely on both chains with the seller receiving the funds on Ethereum while the buyer receives the NFT on Solana, notwithstanding the fact that there is no direct trust between the chains.
The marketplace could further aggregate transactions using ZKMâ€™s succinct proofs which reduces the computing overhead and improves scalability.
